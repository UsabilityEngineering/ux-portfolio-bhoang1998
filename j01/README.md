The Autonomous Edition Smart Hybrid Dual Motor Electric Standing Desk Frame is a decent design that has a few options that seem self explanatory, but could use with a little context. This desk changes height based on the user's preference, but you need to adjust this using the buttons.

This is confusing as there seems to be no indicators to how the height based on the number options and the same to the "M" option that doesn't have and context as to what it does. The only saving grace is that its **learnable** with the use of the lowering or raising arrows. The **safety** of this device is pretty bad as there is no safety measure to ensure nothing is crushed with lowering of the desk. It is **useful** by adjusting the desk to suit the needs be it to adjust desk height based on the user. 

One such situation is when setting up the desk as a work desk during my school time online during the covid classes I would need to set the table to a height that matched my chair, but when I'm relaxing and watching a movie I would like the desk to be set higher as to watch from the bed. Personally I feel that the numbers seem to confuse me and seem impractical to use as there is no specification on how tall or low the table will be on each setting. I personally enjoy the up and down arrows as the table raises and lowers to a height I personally enjoy for a unique purpose. I feel I wouldn't want to mess with the other options.

Overall, it is an enjoyable device, but it lacks **error tolerance** and **safety**.
